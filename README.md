# SUSPEND
I'd like to pack `primitive` into a independent library called __Atlas__ to learn building VM, which dreams becoming an Operating System like __Fushcia__ one day, at the same time, a new Programming Language named __Sonata__, is in building, based on rust, as the starting point.

As soon as __Atlas__ is good enough to use, I'll be back, monthes later, more infomation if you need, keep time on my [blog][wr].

# Luna
Luna is a peer to peer micro smart-contract platform.

## Roadmap
The implementation is lucid, first for `Blockchain`, second for `VM`, and then, `Common Client`, [weekly record][wr].

## Status
Experimental project aims to explore the law of Cypherworld. For the first step, all we need to do is implementing a chain of block, [details](./DETAILS.md).

## Contributing
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on, launching yourself into space, you will find us in the tin can beyond the horizon under the velvetground.
